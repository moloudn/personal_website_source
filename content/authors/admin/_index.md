Hello, I am Ehsan Sadrfaridpour, a Ph.D. student at Clemson University studying Biomedical Data Science and Informatics. I have experience in developing scalable machine learning algorithms for application in text mining and health care. I work under the supervision of professor [Ilya Safro](https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~isafro/) in the <a href="https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~isafro/group.html">Algorithms and Computational Science Lab</a>.
